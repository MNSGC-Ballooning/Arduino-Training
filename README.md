## Exercises currently included in this tutorial:
1. BasicBlink - a simple program to blink an led repeatedly, introducing basic sketch layout
2. Sweep - introduces objects and built-in libraries by driving a servo
3. AnalogPressure - introduces reading sensors, starting with a raw analog pressure sensor
4. AnalogHumidity - more practice with reading analog
5. DigitalAccel - introduces more complicated digital sensors, and the libraries that drive them
6. DigitalPressure - introduces multi-sensor ICs with a combined pressure/temp sensor
7. TempMagLogger - combines digital and analog sensors, and introduces SD datalogging
8. SDTempBus - introduces bus communication using OneWire protocol
9. GPSLogger - switch from computer tether to battery power, logs position of arduino
10. XBeeBlink - led blinking sketch that accepts input over xBee, allowing remote control of arduino
